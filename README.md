# Retail-market-Data-Analysis
The aim of this project is to extract insigths from the data of an online retail company.  We will analyze sales history data and identify key points that made the business profitable or not. These key points should be clear enough to help designing a new sales profitability strategy for the next year by the marketing director of A-to-Z-Market.
